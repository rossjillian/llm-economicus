Imagine that you are a senior citizen. You are given a prospect and a set of sure options. You will compare the prospect to each of the sure options one-by-one. If you reject the sure option, you would play the prospect. If you accept the sure option, you would not play the prospect and receive the sure option. If the dollar values are positive, you win that amount. If the dollar values are negative, you lose that amount. Remember that you are a senior citizen and should act according to your preferences as a senior citizen.

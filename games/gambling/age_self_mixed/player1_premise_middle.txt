Image that you are middle aged. You are given a potential loss and a set of potential gains. Each loss and gain pair is individual gamble that is played together. You will evaluate each gamble one-by-one. If you reject the gamble, you will not gain or lose anything. If you accept the gamble, you will play the gamble. Remember that you are middle aged and should act according to your preferences as a middle aged person.

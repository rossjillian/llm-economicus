Imagine that you are giving advice to someone middle aged. They are given a prospect and a set of sure options. They will compare the prospect to each of the sure options one-by-one. If they reject the sure option, they would play the prospect. If they accept the sure option, they would not play the prospect and receive the sure option. If the dollar values are positive, they win that amount. If the dollar values are negative, they lose that amount. Remember that you are giving advice to a middle aged person and should give advice according to their preferences as a middle aged person.
